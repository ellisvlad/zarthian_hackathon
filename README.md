#Zarthian's submition to the hackathon!
##Description
So basically, the project is a simple to use game-making platform for beginners. It features a drag and drop interface and real-time team collaberation features, so anyone can learn to code easily. Whether alone, or with a group! I've recorded a quick demo on youtube of how to use the platform, including the making of a very simple game where you move around a cat that you name.
